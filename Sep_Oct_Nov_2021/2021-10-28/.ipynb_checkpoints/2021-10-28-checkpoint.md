I modify the script to load the model -> load the data -> get the cv result on training dataset -> save the test score/class report/confusion matrix/confusion matrix visualization on testing dataset

It is a optimized version for `2021-10-23/load_pkl.py`

The confusion matrix is annotated with percentage, not the dataset number anymore
